## PY_em
>-- Could NOT find PY_em (missing: PY_EM)

*Full Error message:*
```
-- Could NOT find PY_em (missing: PY_EM)
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/empy.cmake:29 (message):
  Unable to find either executable 'empy' or Python module 'em'...  try
  installing the package 'python-empy'
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/all.cmake:163 (include)
  /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:20 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:56 (find_package)
```

*Analysis:* catkin finds the python in anaconda, we need to point catkin to the system python.

*Solution:*
```
catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3
```

## rospkg
>ModuleNotFoundError :No module named 'rospkg'

*Analysis:* Happens when running `roscreate-pkg`. This could because you are running the file with the wrong python interpreter.

*Solutions:*
1. change teh shebang in the python files. For noetic or later, use `#!/usr/bin/env python3`; for melodic or earlier, use `#!/usr/bin/env python2`.
2. run `pip install rospkg`.

## gazebo
>Can't open /usr/share/gazebo//setup.sh

*Analysis:* The problem is in the scripts located in `/opt/ros/indigo/lib/gazebo_ros`. There are several scripts (i.e. gzclient, gzserver, etc.) which are executed when you perform a `rosrun` command. When trying to run gazebo, ROS needs to source the gazebo `setup.sh` script to make sure that the proper gazebo paths are defined. This is the line in the ROS scripts which has a problem:
`setup_path=$(pkg-config --variable=prefix gazebo)/share/gazebo/`
The problem is that `pkg-config` should find the path to gazebo, but it doesn't seem to work. Since it doesn't find gazebo, the script just continues execution using "/share/gazebo/" as the path. Also, it looks like there is an extra slash at the end.

*Solution:* A simple workaround: change `setup_path=/usr/share/gazebo` in `gzclient` and `gzserver`.

# Make OKVIS

## Bullet
>No package 'bullet' found.

*Full error message:*
```
-- Checking for module 'bullet>=2.82'
-- No package 'bullet' found
-- Checking for module 'bullet2.82>=2.82'
-- No package 'bullet2.82' found
CMake Error at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/gazebo/gazebo-config.cmake:102 (message):
Error: Bullet > 2.82 not found, please install libbullet2.82-dev.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package)
```

*Solution:* 
1. find `bullet.pc` with `sudo find / -name "bullet.pc"`;
2. Add the directory to `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` with `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKF_CONFIG_PATH:<folder_containing_bullet.pc>`.

## OGRE
>Could not find a configuration file for package ogre.

*Full Error Message:*
```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:46 (find_package):
By not providing "FindOGRE.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "OGRE", but
CMake did not find one.

Could not find a package configuration file provided by "OGRE" with any of
the following names:

OGREConfig.cmake
ogre-config.cmake

Add the installation prefix of "OGRE" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
"OGRE_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "OGRE"
provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
installed.


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
```

*Analysis:* CMake failed to look at the right path.

*Solution:* add `set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "/usr/share/OGRE/cmake/modules/;${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}")` to the CMakeLists.txt

[ref-link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15982661/error-with-ogre-and-cmake), [cmake-find_path()](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/find_path.html).


## image_geometry and others
>Could not find a configuration file for package image_geometry.

*Full Error Message:*
```
CMake Error at /opt/ros/hydro/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:75 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package image_geometry.

  Set image_geometry_DIR to the directory containing a CMake configuration
  file for image_geometry.  The file will have one of the following names:

    image_geometryConfig.cmake
    image_geometry-config.cmake

Call Stack (most recent call first):
  viso2-hydro/viso2_ros/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package)
```

*Analysis:* packages not installed.

*Solution:* run `sudo apt install ros-noetic-image-geometry`



## ceres-solver
>cc1plus: some warnings are being treated as errors

*Full Error Message:*
```
xxxxxx/ceres/schur_eliminator.h:267:10:
    struct Chunk {
           ^~~~~
cc1plus: some warnings are being treated as errors
internal/ceres/CMakeFiles/ceres.dir/build.make:2558: recipe for target 'internal/ceres/CMakeFiles/ceres.dir/generated/schur_eliminator_2_2_2.cc.o' failed
```

*Analysis:* Problem tag when downloading ceres1.9.0

*Solution:* change the tag from `7c57de5080c9f5a4f067e2d20b5f33bad5b1ade6` to `451e71c6b7c127ebfd29f0eb658543d512629a4e`. Then, `cd` to `/catkin_ws/build/okvis_ros/okvis/ceres/src/ceres-external`, modify CMakeLists.txt:ln 643, delete the `-Werror` flag.

## Eigen

>fatal error: Eigen/Dense: no such file or directory

*Analysis:* Eigen is installed in the folder named `eigen3`, not `Eigen`, creating soft links solves the problem.

*Solution:*: do the following command
```
cd /usr/local/incllude
sudo ln -sf eigen3/Eigen Eigen
sudo ln -sf eigen3/unsupported unsupported
```

### ros+eigen
>CMake Error at xxx.

*Full Error Message:*
```
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/pcl_ros/cmake/pcl_rosConfig.cmake:113(message):
project 'pcl_ros' specifies '/usr/include/eigen3' as an include dir,which is not found. 
it does neither exist as an absolute directory nor in……'
```

*Analysis:* mismatch between the self-installed (from source) Eigen (`/usr/local/include/eigen3`)and the path pre-defined in ROS packages (`/usr/include/eigen3`).

*Solutions:*
1. change the correspoinding *.cmake file, change `/usr/include/eigen3;` to `/usr/local/include/eigen3`. TEDIOUS, lots of files need to be changed.
2. Since eigen3 folder only stores the headers, directly copy `/usr/local/include/eigen3` to `/usr/include/eigen3`.

## pcl
>error: #error PCL requires C++14 or above

*Solution:* change C++ standard in cmake file.
In `/okvis_ros/CMakeList.txt`, add
```
set(CMAKE_CSS_STANDARD 14)
set(CMAKE_CSS_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```
right after the project line.

## dataset_convertor.cpp

*Solution:* change all `ofstream` to `std::ofstream`.

## OpenCV

### libgtk error

*Full Error Message:*
```
error: (-2:Unspecified error) the function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+2.x or Carbon support. If you are on Unbunto or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-runn camke or configuration script in function 'cvNamedWindow'
```

*Analysis:* opencv failed to find the libgtk+-2.0 library.

*Solution:* 
1. Install libgtk with `sudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev`
2. Find the path to the libgtk package, Set up `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` in `.bashrc` file. Add `PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig`.
3. Re-build opencv with flag `-D WITH_GTK=ON`. e.g. `cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib-3.4.13/modules -D WITH_CUDA=ON -D WITH_CUDNN=OFF -D BUILD_opencv_cudacodec=OFF -D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON -DBUILD_JAVA=OFF -DBUILD_opencv_java_bindings_generator=OFF -D BUILD_PYTHON=OFF -D BUILD_opencv_python_bindings_generator=OFF -D WITH_QT=ON -D ENABLE_CXX11=ON -D BUILD_TIFF=ON -D WITH_GTK=ON ..`

## gtstream
>fatal error: gst/gst.h: no such file or directory

*Analysis:* anacodna package conflicts. 

*Solution:* move anaconda to `Trash`, complete installation, and move it back.
